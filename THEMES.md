## Tips

- **Flexible naming:** Write themes however you like - `"brutalist-lime"`, `"brutalist lime"`, or `"Brutalist Lime"` all work!
- **Case doesn't matter:** `"Light"`, `"light"`, or `"LIGHT"` - use whatever feels natural
- **Spaces or dashes:** Both `"eclipse-warm"` and `"eclipse warm"` work perfectly
- If a theme isn't found, it defaults to the Light theme
- Preview all themes by changing the value in `config.js` and refreshing your browser
- Mix and match - try different themes until you find your perfect match!
